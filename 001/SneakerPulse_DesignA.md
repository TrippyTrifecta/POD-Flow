# SneakerPulse Design A

## Objective
- Create a high-impact sneaker concept aligned with SneakerPulse brand and production realities.

## Target Audience
- Core sneaker enthusiasts ages 16-30; trend seekers with interest in bold, streetwear-inspired aesthetics.

## Constraints
- Brand tone: bold, confident; color palette limited to black/white with one accent color; typography to be modern sans.

## Variant Prompts
- Variant 1: High-contrast streetwear silhouette, black+white with neon accent. Mood: edgy, energetic.
- Variant 2: Minimalist silhouette with strong typography, black/white with a single accent color. Mood: clean, premium.
- Variant 3: Layered texture and graphic pattern for visual depth; consider print capabilities on common fabrics.

## Asset Lists
- Fabric swatches, mockup models, product photos, typography files, CMYK color profiles.

## Data Models
- SKU, size ranges, production batch notes (fabric/print specs).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear alignment with brand and production feasibility; at least two asset sets ready for mockups.
